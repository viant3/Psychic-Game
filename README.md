# Psychic-Game

In this game, the computer chooses a random letter from a-z. You have 9 chances to guess the letter that was chosen.

If you choose correctly, a win is recorded and the game starts again. If you fail to choose the correct letter after nine tries,
a loss is recorded and the game starts again. 

In each case, a winning or losing message is displayed.
